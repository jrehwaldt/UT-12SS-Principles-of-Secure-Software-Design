A) Take Asset Model and transform it to BPMN
============================================

1. Actors -> Lanes (and Pools)
2. Resources -> Data objects
3a. Goal -> (Throwing) Intermediate Event
3b. Plan -> Task
	- put into lane according to closest actor
	  except it's inside a boundary with an actor
	  attached -> then add to this lane
4. Decomposition -> Sub-Tasks
	- Means-End related Plans / Goals of decomposed
	  Entities are also included within Sub-Task
5. Directed Dependency between Goal / Plan ->
   Directed Sequence Flow between resulting Tasks / Events in
   inverse order to Dependency Relationship
6. Means-End from Goal / Plan to Resource ->
   Combine Task with Data Object (read-write)
7. Means-End from Goal / Plan to Goal / Plan ->
   Sequence Flow or, if multiple Means-Ends go to same
   Goal / Plan combine those with AND-Gateway
8. Security Constraints ->
   Annotation / Comment and link with Target
   

Result
- Security constraints are only preserved as comments,
  rest is successfully transformed
- no order between Tasks could be obtained, except
  for directed Dependency links and Means-End relations
- Means-End from Goal / Plan to Goal / Plan
  may not be successfully transformed as
  it may not be clear whether it should be a Sub-Task
  or rather an AND-Gateway


B) Take Thread Definition Model and transform it to BPMN
========================================================

1. Add Lane for any additional Actor (e.g. Attacker)
2. Perform Transformation Steps from A) for all
   additional artifacts (e.g. the ones within Attacker
   boundary)
3. Attacks from Goal / Plan to Resource ->
   Combine Task with Data Object (read-write)
4. Exploits from Goal / Plan to Goal / Plan ->
   Add Message Flow from Goal / Plan to Goeal / Plan

Result
- Vulnerability Points are implicitly identified
  by target of exploits Message Flow
- Attacker activities and and Actors are successfully
  contributed to the first step's BPMN model


C) Take Risk Treatment Model and transform it to BPMN
=====================================================

1. Add additional Goal / Plan / Resource
   according to rules from A) and B)
2. Mitigates from Goal / Plan to Threat ->
   Add as Annotation to source Goal / Plan
3. Impact + / - from Threat to Resource ->
   Add as Annotation to Attack/Relationship,
   if existing, discard otherwise (also see result)

Result
- Impact link may become visible when splitting BPMN
  diagram into pre- and post-Risk Treatment versions


D) Finalize
===========

1. Collapse all empty lanes to pools
2. Remove eventually doubled Sequence Flows etc.


E) Manual steps
===============

1. Link unlinked Tasks with each other
2. Define starting and end points, possibly additional events
3. Revise Tasks and especiallz Events for specialiyed types
   (e.g. Message Event)
4. Combine or Split Tasks
