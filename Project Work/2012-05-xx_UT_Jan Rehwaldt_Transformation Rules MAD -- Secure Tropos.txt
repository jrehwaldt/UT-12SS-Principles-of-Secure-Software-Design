Resulting models from A-C may be treated separately (as proposed
for Secure Tropos), but in order to continue automated
transformation the steps from B depend on A and from C on A+B.


A) Content and Asset Identification model
=========================================

1. Swimline -> Actor
2. Activity -> Plan
	-> Put into boundaries of swimlane's Actor
3. Sequence Flow -> Basically no mapping within Secure
   Tropos fits the requirements; discard order
4. Decision Point -> Means-End with previous Entity;
   Transform previous Plan to Goal
5. Last Activity -> Goal
6. Copy Goal from #5 into all other boundaries, which do not yet
   have a main Goal (for step #B)
	-> add Dependency link from #5 to its Copies preserving
	   the Activity's order, if possible
7. All unlinked Plans and Goals within an Actor Boundary are made
   a Means-End of Goal from #5 or #6

Result
- Activity / Plan order is discarded
- Decision Points are not clearly transformed
- Start- and End-Point are discarded
- Goals may *not* be automatically derived
- Links (Decomposition, Means-End, ...) may not be derived
  in a very sophisticated way


B) Risk Analysis model
======================

1. Create Actors as defined in A.1
2. Derive Plans and Goals as defined in A.2-7
3. Add Exploits-Relations for Sequence Flows from Mal-Activity
   to Activity
4. Add Attacks-Relation from Goal B.2[A.5] to Goal A.5

Result
- mainly as defined in A


C) Security Requirements Definition
===================================

1. Create Actors as defined in A.1
2. Derive Plans as defined in A.2-3
3. Add Mitigates-Relations for Sequence Flows from Mal-Activity
   to Countermeasure-Activity

Result
- Mitigates-Relations successfully derived
- Impact-Relations may *not* be automatically derived
- Security Contraints may *not* be automatically derived


D) Finalization
===============

E) Manual Work
==============

1. Revise the diagram
2. Add Security Contraints
3. ...
